# 🌾 Soilink - Empowering Agriculture Digitally

Soilink is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application designed to bridge the gap between **farmers** and **consumers**. The platform enables **farmers to rent out their land** during off-seasons and **sell their crops**, while **users** can **rent land** for cultivation and **order fresh produce** directly from farmers.
